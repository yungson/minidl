# minidl
 
A simple light-weight deep learning framework to quickly explore and test ideas. It can be used to tailor to personal needs for research. The framework is implemented using a Python Object Oriented Programming where each the whole deep learning process is decomposed into serveral class and each class accomplish its own work, hold its own data when necessary


## installation

```
git clone git@github.com:yungson/minidl.git
export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:<the root directory of the downloaded repo>
```

## functions

- `datagen.py`:

## examples 

 **DNN**
See [mnist](./examples/mnist/run_mnist.ipynb). 

A simple network structure can achieve `train_accuracy: 0.9922333333333333, test_accuracy: 0.9763`. This is a good demostration that the framework is working correctly.

## TODO

I will add CNN, RNN and attention in the future ðŸ™‚
